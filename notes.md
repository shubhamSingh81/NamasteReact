# install formik library for createing form -> 
# install React Router for createing routes
# there are Two type of Routing Exist -> client side and server side
# All the children will go into outLet according to the routes.

// Cs Things : 
-> Normal Native Css
-> SCSS
-> inlise css
-> component Libraries : Materail Ui , Base Ui, Ant , Chakra UI -> these all are nothing but its a packages.
-> styled Component

// Going to learn Tailwind CSS Frameworks
 - Css on the go(in the same file)
 - reusability
 - less bundle size
 - flexible ui (customization)
 - 

 pros of tailwind -> easy to debug
                   - code is less 
                   - faster development time
                   - it's giving a lot more control

cons of tailwind -> so much classname
                   - there is a high learning curve
                   -
